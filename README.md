# Ember-App
#### A sample Ember.js app

## What's Here?

This is a basic skeleton application to demonstrate structure, dependencies, and patterns for building Zooniverse projects with [Ember.js](http://emberjs.com).

Also included are
  - Some helpers
  - General [Zooniverse library](https://github.com/zooniverse/Zooniverse) setup
  - An authenticated route example
  - Translation examples
  - Monkey patches I've generally found useful
  - A barebones [bootstrap grid](http://getbootstrap.com/css/#grid)

## Getting Started
  - `npm install .` to install dependencies
  - `haw serve` to work against the development API (or `npm start`)
  - `haw serve --port 9295` to work against a local API
  - `npm run-script stage` to deploy to [a staging bucket](http://demo.zooniverse.org/ember-app)
